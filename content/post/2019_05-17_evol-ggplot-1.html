<h3>🏁 Aim of this Tutorial</h3>
<p>In this series of blog posts, I aim to show you how to turn a default ggplot into a plot that visualizes information in an appealing and easily understandable way. The goal of each blog post is to provide a step-by-step tutorial explaining how my visualization have evolved from a typical basic ggplot. All plots are going to be created with 100% <code>ggplot2</code> and 0% Inkscape.</p>
<p>In the first episode, I transform a basic boxplot into a colorful and self-explanatory combination of a jittered dot strip plot and a lollipop plot. I am going to use <a href="http://data.uis.unesco.org/index.aspx?queryid=180">data provided by the UNESCO on global student to teacher ratios</a> that was selected as data <a href="https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-05-07">#TidyTuesday challenge 19 of 2019</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="data" class="section level3">
<h3>🗃️ Data Preparation</h3>
<p>I have prepared the data in the first way to map each countrys most recently reported student-teacher ratio in primary education as a tile map. I used the <a href="%22https://gist.githubusercontent.com/maartenzam/787498bbc07ae06b637447dbd430ea0a/raw/9a9dafafb44d8990f85243a9c7ca349acd3a0d07/worldtilegrid.csv%22">tile-based world data provided by Maarten Lambrechts</a> to create this map as the first visualization for my weekly contribution:</p>
<p><img src="/post/2019_05-17_evol-ggplot-1_files/figure-html/map-students-1.png" width="768" /></p>
<p>For the second chart next to the tile map, I wanted to highlight the difference of the mean student ratio per continent but without discarding the raw data on the country-level. Therefore, I transformed the information on the region to represent the six continents excluding Antarctica (hm, do penguins not go to school?! Seems so… 🐧) and merged both datasets. If you would like to run the code yourself, you find the data preparation steps <a href="https://gist.github.com/Z3tt/301bb0c7e3565111770121af2bd60c11">here</a>. This is how the relevant columns of the merged and cleaned dataset looks like, showing 2 examples per continent:</p>

<div id="default" class="section level3">
<h3>🌱 The Default Boxplot</h3>
<p>I was particularly interested to visualize the most-recent student-teacher ratio in primary education as a tile chloropleth map per country. A usual way reresenting several data points per group is to use a boxplot:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)

ggplot(df_ratios, aes(region, student_ratio)) +
  geom_boxplot()</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2019_05-17_evol-ggplot-1_files/figure-html/boxplot-basic-1.png" width="768" /></p>
</div>
<div id="sort" class="section level3">
<h3>🔀 ️Sort Your Data!</h3>
<p>A good routine with such kind of data (qualitative and unsorted) to arrange the boxplots (or any other type such as bars or violins) in an in- or decreasing order to increase readability. Since the category “continent” does not have a natural ordering, I rearrange the boxplots by their mean student-teacher ratio instead of alphabetically:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>df_sorted &lt;- df_ratios %&gt;%
  mutate(region = fct_reorder(region, -student_ratio_region))

ggplot(df_sorted, aes(region, student_ratio)) +
  geom_boxplot()</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2019_05-17_evol-ggplot-1_files/figure-html/boxplot-sorted-1.png" width="768" /></p>
<p>💡 <strong>Sort your data according to the best or worst, highest or lowest value to make your graph easily readable - do not sort them if the categories have an internal logical order such as age groups!</strong></p>
<p>To increase the readability we are going to flip the coordinates (note that we could also switch x and y arguments in the <code>ggplot2</code> call - but this does not work for boxplots so we use <code>coord_flip()</code>). It is also a good practice to include the 0 in plots which we can force by adding <code>scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 90))</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(df_sorted, aes(region, student_ratio)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 90))</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2019_05-17_evol-ggplot-1_files/figure-html/boxplot-flipped-1.png" width="768" /></p>
<p>💡 <strong>Flip the chart in case of long labels to increase readability and to avoid overlapping or rotated labels!</strong></p>
<p>The order of the categories is perfect as it is after flipping the coordinates - the lower the student-teacher ratio, the better.</p>
</div>
<div id="let-your-plot-shine---get-rid-of-the-default-settings" class="section level3">
<h3>💎 Let Your Plot Shine - Get Rid of the Default Settings</h3>
<p>Let’s spice this plot up! One great thing about <code>ggplot2</code> is that it is structured in an <em>adaptive way</em>, allowing to add further levels to an existing ggplot object. We are going to</p>
<ul>
<li>use a different theme that comes with the <code>ggplot2</code> package by calling <code>theme_set(theme_light())</code> (several themes come along with the <code>ggplot2</code> package but if you need more check for example the packages <a href="https://yutannihilation.github.io/allYourFigureAreBelongToUs/ggthemes/"><code>ggthemes</code></a> or <a href="https://hrbrmstr.github.io/hrbrthemes/"><code>hrbrthemes</code></a>),</li>
<li>change the font and the overall font size by adding the arguments <code>base_size</code> and <code>base_family</code> to <code>theme_light()</code>,</li>
<li>flip the axes by adding <code>coord_flip()</code> (as seen before),</li>
<li>let the axis start at 0 and reduce the spacing to the plot margin by adding <code>expand = c(0.005, 0.005)</code> as argument to the <code>scale_y_continious()</code>,</li>
<li>add some color encoding the continent by adding <code>color = region</code> to the <code>aes</code> argument and piciking a palette from the <a href=""><code>ggsci</code> package</a>,</li>
<li>add meaningful labels/removing useless labels by adding adding <code>labs(x = NULL, y = "title y")</code></li>
<li>adjust the new theme (e.g. changing some font settings and removing the legend and grid) by adding <code>theme()</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>💡 <strong>You can easily adjust all sizes of the theme by calling theme_xyz(base_size = ) + this is very handy if you need the same viz for a different purpose!</strong></p>
<p>💡 <strong>Do not use c(0, 0) since the zero tick is in most cases too close to the axis - use c(0.005, 0.005) instead!</strong></p>
<p>I am going to save the ggplot call and all these visual adjustments in <code>gg</code> object called <code>g</code> so we can use it for the next plots.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>extrafont::loadfonts(device = &quot;win&quot;)

theme_set(theme_light(base_size = 15, base_family = &quot;Poppins&quot;))

g &lt;- ggplot(df_sorted, aes(region, student_ratio, color = region)) +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 90), expand = c(0.005, 0.005)) +
  scale_color_uchicago() +
  labs(x = NULL, y = &quot;Student to teacher ratio&quot;) +
  theme(legend.position = &quot;none&quot;,
        axis.title = element_text(size = 12),
        axis.text.x = element_text(family = &quot;Roboto Mono&quot;, size = 10),
        panel.grid = element_blank())</code></pre>
<p>(Note that to include these fonts we make use of the <a href="https://github.com/wch/extrafont"><code>extrafont</code> package</a>. You need to have (a) the fonts installed on your system, (b) the package <code>extrafont</code> installed and (c) imported your fonts by running <code>extrafont::font_import()</code>.)</p>
</div>
<div id="geoms" class="section level3">
<h3>📊 The Choice of the Chart Type</h3>
<p>We can add any <code>geom_</code> to our ggplot-preset <code>g</code> that fits the data (note that until now it is jut an empty plot with pretty axes):</p>
<p><img src="/post/2019_05-17_evol-ggplot-1_files/figure-html/geoms-1.png" width="960" /></p>
<p>All of the four chart types let readers explore the range of values but with different detail and focus. The boxplot and the violin plot both summarize the data, they contain a lot of information by visualizing the distribution of the data points in two different ways. By contrast, the dot strip plot and the line plot show the raw data. However, a line chart is not a good choice here since it does not allow for the identification of single countries. By adding an <code>alpha</code> argument to <code>geom_point()</code>, the dot strip plot is able to highlight the range of student-teacher ratios while providing the raw data:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>g + geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.15)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2019_05-17_evol-ggplot-1_files/figure-html/dot-plot-alpha-1.png" width="768" /></p>
<p>Of course, different geoms can also be combined to provide even more information in one plot:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>g + geom_boxplot(color = &quot;grey60&quot;, outlier.alpha = 0) +
  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.15)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2019_05-17_evol-ggplot-1_files/figure-html/box-dot-plot-1.png" width="768" /></p>
<p>⚡ <strong>Remove the outliers to avoid overlapping points! You can achieve this via <code>outlier.shape = NA</code> or <code>outlier.alpha = 0</code>.</strong></p>
<p>We are going to stick to points to visualize the countries explicitly instead of aggregating the data into box- or violin plots.
To achieve a higher readability, we use another geom, <code>geom_jitter()</code> which scatters the points in a given direction (x and/or y via <code>width</code> and <code>height</code>) to prevent overplotting:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>set.seed(123)

g + geom_jitter(size = 2, alpha = 0.25, width = 0.2)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2019_05-17_evol-ggplot-1_files/figure-html/plot-jitter-countries-1.png" width="768" /></p>
<p>💡 <strong>Set a seed to keep the jittering of the points fixed every time you call <code>geom_jitter()</code> by calling <code>set.seed()</code> - this becomes especially important when we later label some of the points.</strong></p>
<p>(I am going to the redundant call of <code>set.seed(123)</code> in the next code chunks.)</p>
</div>
<div id="more" class="section level3">
<h3>💯 More Geoms, More Fun, More Info!</h3>
<p>As mentioned in the beginning, my intention was to visualize both, the country- and continental-level ratios, in addition to the tile map. Until now, we focussed on countries only. We can indicate the continental average by adding another <code>geom_point()</code> which has to differ from the points of <code>geom_jitter()</code>. Since the average is more important here, I am going to highlight it with a bigger size and zero transparency:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>g +
  geom_jitter(size = 2, alpha = 0.25, width = 0.2) +
  geom_point(aes(region, student_ratio_region), size = 5)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2019_05-17_evol-ggplot-1_files/figure-html/plot-jitter-regions-1.png" width="768" /></p>
<p>To relate all these points to a baseline, we add a line indicating the worldwide average:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>world_avg &lt;- df_ratios %&gt;%
  summarize(avg = mean(student_ratio, na.rm = T)) %&gt;%
  pull(avg)

g +
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = world_avg), color = &quot;grey70&quot;, size = 0.6) +
  geom_point(aes(region, student_ratio_region), size = 5) +
  geom_jitter(size = 2, alpha = 0.25, width = 0.2)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2019_05-17_evol-ggplot-1_files/figure-html/worldwide-avg-1.png" width="768" /></p>
<p>💡 <strong>One could derive the worldwide average also within the <code>geom_hline()</code> call, but I prefer to keep both steps separated.</strong></p>
<p>We can further highlight that the baseline is the worldwide average ratio rather than a ratio of 0 (or 1?) by adding a line from each continental average to the worldwide average. The result is a combination of a jitter and a lollipop plot:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>g +
  geom_segment(aes(x = region, xend = region,
                   y = world_avg, yend = student_ratio_region),
               size = 0.8) +
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = world_avg), color = &quot;grey70&quot;, size = 0.6) +
  geom_jitter(size = 2, alpha = 0.25, width = 0.2) +
  geom_point(aes(region, student_ratio_region), size = 5)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2019_05-17_evol-ggplot-1_files/figure-html/plot-jitter-regions-world-1.png" width="768" /></p>
<p>⚡ <strong>Check the order of the geoms to prevent any overlapping - here, for example, draw the line after calling <code>geom_segment()</code> to avoid overlapping!</strong></p>
</div>
<div id="text" class="section level3">
<h3>💬 Add Text Boxes to Let The Plot Speak for Itself</h3>
<p>Since I don’t want to include legends, I add some text boxes that explain the different point sizes and the baseline level via <code>annotate("text")</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>(g_text &lt;- g +
  geom_segment(aes(x = region, xend = region,
                   y = world_avg, yend = student_ratio_region),
               size = 0.8) +
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = world_avg), color = &quot;grey70&quot;, size = 0.6) +
  geom_point(aes(region, student_ratio_region), size = 5) +
  geom_jitter(size = 2, alpha = 0.25, width = 0.2) +
  annotate(&quot;text&quot;, x = 6.3, y = 35, family = &quot;Poppins&quot;, size = 2.7, color = &quot;grey20&quot;,
           label = glue::glue(&quot;Worldwide average:\n{round(world_avg, 1)} students per teacher&quot;)) +
  annotate(&quot;text&quot;, x = 3.5, y = 10, family = &quot;Poppins&quot;, size = 2.7, color = &quot;grey20&quot;,
           label = &quot;Continental average&quot;) +
  annotate(&quot;text&quot;, x = 1.7, y = 11, family = &quot;Poppins&quot;, size = 2.7, color = &quot;grey20&quot;,
           label = &quot;Countries per continent&quot;) +
  annotate(&quot;text&quot;, x = 1.9, y = 64, family = &quot;Poppins&quot;, size = 2.7, color = &quot;grey20&quot;,
           label = &quot;The Central African Republic has by far\nthe most students per teacher&quot;))</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2019_05-17_evol-ggplot-1_files/figure-html/text-labels-1.png" width="768" /></p>
<p>💡 <strong>Use <a href="https://glue.tidyverse.org/"><code>glue::glue()</code></a> to combine strings with variables - this way, you can update your plots without copying and pasting values! (Of course, you can also use your good old friend <code>paste0()</code>.)</strong></p>
<p>… and add some arrows to match the text to the visual elements by providing start- and endpoints of the arrows when calling <code>geom_curve()</code>. I am going to draw all arrows with one call - but you could also draw arrow by arrow. This is not that simple as the absolute position depends on the dimension of the plot. Good guess based on the coordinates of the text boxes…</p>
<pre class="r"><code>arrows &lt;- tibble(
  x1 = c(6.2, 3.5, 1.7, 1.7, 1.9),
  x2 = c(5.6, 4, 1.9, 2.9, 1.1),
  y1 = c(35, 10, 11, 11, 73),
  y2 = c(world_avg, 19.4, 14.1, 12, 83.4)
)

g_text + geom_curve(data = arrows, aes(x = x1, y = y1, xend = x2, yend = y2),
             arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.07, &quot;inch&quot;)), size = 0.4,
             color = &quot;grey20&quot;, curvature = -0.3)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2019_05-17_evol-ggplot-1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>… and then adjust, adjust, adjust…</p>
<pre class="r"><code>arrows &lt;- tibble(
  x1 = c(6, 3.65, 1.8, 1.8, 1.8),
  x2 = c(5.6, 4, 2.07, 2.78, 1.08),
  y1 = c(world_avg + 6, 10.5, 9, 9, 76),
  y2 = c(world_avg + 0.1, 18.4, 14.48, 12, 83.41195)
)

(g_arrows &lt;- g_text +
  geom_curve(data = arrows, aes(x = x1, y = y1, xend = x2, yend = y2),
             arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.08, &quot;inch&quot;)), size = 0.5,
             color = &quot;grey20&quot;, curvature = -0.3))</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2019_05-17_evol-ggplot-1_files/figure-html/text-arrows-1.png" width="768" /></p>
<p>💡 <strong>Since the curvature is the same for all arrows, one can use different x and y distances and directions between the start end and points to vary their shape!</strong></p>
<p>One last thing that bothers me: A student-teacher ratio of 0 does not make much sense - I definitely prefer to start at a ratio of 1!<br />
And - oh my! - we almost forgot to mention and acknowledge the data source 😨 Let’s quickly also add a plot caption:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>(g_final &lt;- g_arrows +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 90), expand = c(0.005, 0.005),
                     breaks = c(1, seq(20, 80, by = 20))) +
  labs(caption = &quot;Data: UNESCO Institute for Statistics&quot;) +
  theme(plot.caption = element_text(size = 9, color = &quot;grey50&quot;)))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Scale for &#39;y&#39; is already present. Adding another scale for &#39;y&#39;, which
## will replace the existing scale.</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2019_05-17_evol-ggplot-1_files/figure-html/final-caption-1.png" width="768" /></p>
</div>
<div id="legend" class="section level3">
<h3>🗺️ Bonus: Add a Tile Map as Legend</h3>
<p>To make it easier to match the countries of the second plot, the country-level tile map, to each continent we have visualized with our jitter plot, we can add a geographical “legend”. For this, I encode the region by color instead by the country-level ratios:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>(map_regions &lt;- df_sorted %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y, fill = region, color = region)) +
    geom_tile(color = &quot;white&quot;) +
    scale_y_reverse() +
    scale_fill_uchicago(guide = F) +
    coord_equal() +
    theme(line = element_blank(),
          panel.background = element_rect(fill = &quot;transparent&quot;),
          plot.background = element_rect(fill = &quot;transparent&quot;,
                                         color = &quot;transparent&quot;),
          panel.border = element_rect(color = &quot;transparent&quot;),
          strip.background = element_rect(color = &quot;grey20&quot;),
          axis.text = element_blank(),
          plot.margin = margin(0, 0, 0, 0)) +
    labs(x = NULL, y = NULL))</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2019_05-17_evol-ggplot-1_files/figure-html/map-regions-1.png" width="624" /></p>
<p>… and add this map to the existing plot via <code>annotation_custom(ggplotGrob())</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>g_final +
  annotation_custom(ggplotGrob(map_regions), xmin = 2.5, xmax = 7.5, ymin = 55, ymax = 85)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2019_05-17_evol-ggplot-1_files/figure-html/plot-with.map-1.png" width="768" /></p>
</div>
<div id="final" class="section level3">

<h3>📝 Post Sciptum: Mean versus Median</h3>
<p>One thing I want to highlight is that the final plot does not rperesent the same information as the original boxplot. While I have visualized the man values of each country and across the globe, the box show the 25%, 50% and 75% quartile of the data, The 50% quantile is known as the <em>median</em>, i.e. 50% of the data points fall below this value and the other 50% are higher than this value. My decision to estimate the mean value was based on the fact that my goal was a visualization that is easily understandable to a large audience that are used to mean (“average”) values, However, in case of skewed data, the mean value of a dataset is also biased towards higher or lower values. Let’s compare both a plot based on the mean and the median:</p>

<p>As one can see, the differences between continents stay the same but the worldwide median is lower than the average (19.6 students per teacher versus 23.5), showing that the median student-teacher ratio of Asia and oceania are similar to the worldwide median. These plots now resembles much more the basic boxplot we used in the beginning but may be harder to interpret for some than the one visualzing average ratios.</p>
