## BioMove {#biomove}

The [DFG](https://www.dfg.de/en/funded_projects/current_projects_programmes/list/index.jsp?id=GRK) funded Research Training Group ['Integrating **Biodiversity** Research with **Movement** Ecology in dynamic agricultural landscapes (BioMove)'](https://www.biomove.org/) aims to:

1. link innovative individual research projects that overcome the apparent gap between movement ecology and biodiversity research, employing a joint conceptual framework;

2. strategically combine empirical, experimental and modelling approaches based in one common study area ([AgroScapeLab-Quillow](https://deims.org/270a41c4-33a8-4da6-9258-2ab10916f262), Brandenburg, Germany) of sufficient size to address questions of varying spatial scales;

3. pursue bottom-up and top-down approaches (i.e., study the influence of individual movement processes on biodiversity and infer movement mechanisms from biodiversity patterns, respectively) to better understand possible consequences of movement changes on biodiversity;

4. link impacts of land-use on resource availability, landscape structures and disturbance regimes to movement processes of organisms of different taxa to identify common factors that influence biodiversity patterns.

BioMove is a joint project of the [University of Potsdam](https://www.uni-potsdam.de/) together with [Freie Universit√§t Berlin](https://www.fu-berlin.de/), [Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research (IZW)](http://www.izw-berlin.de/welcome.html) and [Leibniz Centre for Agricultural Landscape Research (ZALF)](http://www.zalf.de/en/Pages/ZALF.aspx) led by [Prof. Dr. Florian Jeltsch](https://www.uni-potsdam.de/ibb-vegnat/members/prof-dr-florian-jeltsch.html) that started in October 2015.


## NLMR (Neutral Landscape Models in `R`) {#nlmr}

During the beginning of our PhD projects, Marco Sciaini and I were not satisfied by the possibilities to modify NLMs with the current software, especially in `R`. This was the rise of the NLMR project (later splitted into the two packages `NLMR` and `landscapetools`).

`NLMR`(https://ropensci.github.io/NLMR/index.html) is an `R` package with a comprehensive collection of algorithms with which to simulate neutral landscape models (NLMs). In combination with [`landscapetools`](https://github.com/ropensci/landscapetools), a utility toolbox to modify simulated NLMs and other raster data, this suite of packages provides a utility toolbox which facilitates an easy workflow with simulated NLMs and other raster data.

Both packages are reviewed by the amazing [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/) community and published in "Methods in Ecology and Evolution": [NLMR and landscapetools: An integrated environment for simulating and modifying neutral landscape models in R](https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.13076).
