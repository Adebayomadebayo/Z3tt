I have a Bachelor of Science in *Life Sciences* and a Master of Science in *Ecology, Evolution & Nature Conservation* at the University of Potsdam. In my theses I have predicted behaviors of wild boar by using acceleration data and I have built an [agent-based model to investigate responses of birds to global change using an animal functional type (AFT) approach](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2015.07.005).  

Since 2015 I am the speaker of the GfOe working group ["Young Modellers in Ecology"](https://youngmodellers.github.io/) and together with other motivated team members we organised three annual workshops and a [thematic topic session at the joint conference of BES and GfOe](https://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/events/annual-meeting-2017/thematic-topic-ghent-2017/) in December 2017.
