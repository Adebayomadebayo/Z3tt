      <description>I have a Bachelor of Science in Life Sciences and a Master of Science in Ecology, Evolution &amp;amp; Nature Conservation at the University of Potsdam. In my theses I have predicted behaviors of wild boar by using acceleration data and I have built an agent-based model to investigate responses of birds to global change using an animal functional type (AFT) approach.
Since 2015 I am the speaker of the GfOe working group &amp;ldquo;Young Modellers in Ecology&amp;rdquo; and together with other motivated team members we organised three annual workshops and a thematic topic session at the joint conference of BES and GfOe in December 2017.</description>

      <description>BioMove The DFG funded Research Training Group &amp;lsquo;Integrating Biodiversity Research with Movement Ecology in dynamic agricultural landscapes (BioMove)&amp;rsquo; aims to:
 link innovative individual research projects that overcome the apparent gap between movement ecology and biodiversity research, employing a joint conceptual framework;
 strategically combine empirical, experimental and modelling approaches based in one common study area (AgroScapeLab-Quillow, Brandenburg, Germany) of sufficient size to address questions of varying spatial scales;</description>
