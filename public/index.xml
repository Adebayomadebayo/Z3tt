      <description>Table of ContentIntroductionData Preparation with the tidyverseData Visualization with ggplot2How to Calculate the Percentage ValuesHow to Position the Percentage Labels Inside the BarsHow to Color the Bars Using Different ColorsPolish Your PlotAlternatives Improving the AccessibilityIntroductionBar charts are likely the most common chart type out there and come in several varieties. Most notably, direct labels can increase accessibility of a bar graph and reduce the ‚Äúchart junk‚Äù since grid lines, axis labels, and even axis titles become obsolete.</description>

      <description>What&amp;rsquo;s the #30DayChartChallenge? The #30DayChartChallenge is a data visualization challenge with the aim to create a data visualization on a certain topic for each day of April. Anyone is welcome to contribute, no matter which data source or tool is used to create the visualizations. The challenge is inspired by the #30DayMapChallenge which was initiated by Topi Tjukanov in 2019. I did participate back then and while it was exhausting</description>

      <description>Uff, what a year! 366 days ago, most people did not expect 2020 to be that exhausting, emotionally and physically (and let&amp;rsquo;s hope for a better 2021‚Äîhappy new year to you!). COVID19 was literally everywhere, whether in the media or affecting your personal life, and made it hard to focus and keep social contacts. Plus all the other things that were happening: starting off with the bushfires in Australia, the massive series of police brutality protests after the shocking death of George Floyd, tiring and everlasting Brexit negotiations, Trump&amp;rsquo;s madness reaching new levels, and all the news and uncertainty around COVID19 mutations circulating at the end of 2020.</description>

      <description>Update December 24th 2020: My table made it into the &amp;ldquo;Honourable Mentions&amp;rdquo; section. Congrats to the winner Niels van der Velden and all the others that are mentioned!
In consequence, I decided to visualize the top 250 TV shows according to IMDb users as a more helpful table then the original one on IMDb as my contribution to the ongoing RStudio table contest:
 Tables are a fantastic way to communicate lists of quantitative and qualitative information.</description>

      <description>p.small {line-height: 1.15;font-size:80%}Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19 or simply Corona‚Äîwhat started as an epidemic in China‚Äôs Hubei province has become a global pandemic, leading to hundreds of thousands of infections and thousands of deaths so far, national lockdowns and quarantines of cities, #stayhome and #flattenthecurve hashtags‚Äîand obviously a global shortage of toilet paper.
When the corona pandemic started, I felt scared, curious and tired at the same time.</description>

During a series of massive bushfires across Australia, large areas have been burned and the fires are still burning. The bushfire is one of the worst wildfires globally seen in decades. Although Australia always experiences a fire season during the summer, this time it has been worse than usually: 27 people died and more than 2,000 homes have been destroyed or damaged alone in the worst-hit state of New South Wales.</description>

      <description>At the end of an exiting second #TidyTuesday year, Jon Harmon, host of the TidyTuesday Podcast, asked on Twitter:
What was your favorite #TidyTuesday dataset of 2019? What were some of your favorite visualizations? Why? Let me know with an @ or via #BestTidyTuesday2019!
&amp;mdash; TidyTuesday Podcast (@tidypod) December 12, 2019 I took this opportunity to recap the last year of contributions to the #TidyTuesday challenge. Immediately, several contributions came to my mind and I tried to pick the best from those I&amp;rsquo;ve seen and which I remember.</description>

      <description>During this time of the year, lunch conversations often focus around the question &amp;ldquo;Will there be snow on Christmas Eve here in Berlin/Germany?&amp;rdquo;. I remember white Christmas to be a thing when I was a child but in my memory this happened way more often back then than nowadays. And this seems to be in line with the stories of my Berlin-based colleagues about lots of snow during their childhood. But is it true?</description>

      <description>What&amp;rsquo;s the #30DayMapChallenge? The #30DayMapChallenge which was initiated by Topi Tjukanov in 2019. The goal is to create a map each day of November with a broad topic provided by Topi, no matter which tool, and to share it with the hashtag &amp;ldquo;#30DayMapChallenge&amp;rdquo; on Twitter.
 The idea is to create (and publish) maps based on different themes on each day of the month using the hashtag #30DayMapChallenge, You can prepare the maps beforehand, but the main idea is to publish maps from specific topics on specific days listed below.</description>

      <description>Sunday Two days ago, I was sitting in the sun with a friend working in UX and Graphic Design, chatting about DataViz:
 She: &amp;ldquo;Oh man, last week we had one customer asking for a bar chart race. Do you know these?&amp;rdquo;
Me: &amp;ldquo;Yes&amp;hellip; They are literally EVERYWHERE 1&amp;rdquo;.She: &amp;ldquo;Yeah, and we had some tough time to make that work and to customize it in Adobe Animate.&amp;rdquo;
Me: &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;
She: &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip; and I wondered if you could have done this in R?</description>

      <description>During my after-thesis-vacation, I managed to tick off two long-term todo&amp;rsquo;s on my list - set up a homepage and to participate in the #TidyTuesday challenge to strengthen my data science and visualization skills and share my work and code tricks with the amazing Rstats community on Twitter. The #TidyTuesday challenge is a excellent opportunity to do so!
What is it about? The R4DS (&amp;ldquo;R for Data Science&amp;rdquo;) online learning community founded by Jesse Maegan is a great opportunity to train skills related to data wrangling and visualization and forms a network of mentors and learners.</description>

Hi, I am glad you found your way here! Come in, have a look.
I finally managed to set up a personal homepage - and how easy it was! Huge thanks to the developers of the R package {blogdown} Yihui Xie, Amber Thomas and Alison Presmanes Hill and the open-source Hugo framework. Much thanks also to Huabing Zhao for sharing his &amp;ldquo;CleanWhite&amp;rdquo; theme!</description>

      <description>Overview of Research Project As a computational scientist, I apply analytic and mechanistic modeling approaches to answer questions related to the movement ecology of animals and the dynamics of populations, communities and diseases in space and time. By using empirical and simulated data, I investigate how disease dynamics are influenced by movement behavior, landscape structure and seasonality, how disturbances affect stability measures of ecological communities, and how birds respond to global change.</description>
