      <description>Sunday Two days ago, I was sitting in the sun with a friend working in UX and Graphic Design, chatting about DataViz:
 She: &amp;ldquo;Oh man, last week we had one customer asking for a bar chart race. Do you know these?&amp;rdquo;
Me: &amp;ldquo;Yes&amp;hellip; They are literally EVERYWHERE1&amp;rdquo;.She: &amp;ldquo;Yeah, and we had some tough time to make that work and to customize it in Adobe Animate.&amp;rdquo;
Me: &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;
She: &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip; and I wondered if you could have done this in R?</description>

Introductory WordsI don‚Äôt care, just show me the content!
Begin of 2016, I had to prepare my PhD introductory talk and I started using {ggplot2} to visualize my data since I never liked the syntax and style of base plots in R. Because I was short on time, I plotted these figures by try‚Äôn‚Äôerror and with the help of lots of googling. The resource I came always back to was a blog entry called Beautiful plotting in R: A ggplot2 cheatsheet by Zev Ross, posted on 4.</description>

      <description>During my after-thesis-vacation, I managed to tick off two long-term todo&amp;rsquo;s on my list - set up a homepage and to participate in the #TidyTuesday challenge to strengthen my data science and visualization skills and share my work and code tricks with the amazing Rstats community on Twitter. The #TidyTuesday challenge is a excellent opportunity to do so!
What is it about? The R4DS (&amp;ldquo;R for Data Science&amp;rdquo;) online learning community founded by Jesse Maegan is a great opportunity to train skills related to data wrangling and visualization and forms a network of mentors and learners.</description>

      <description>Hi, I am glad you found your way here! Come in, have a look.
I finally managed to set up a personal homepage - and how easy it was! Huge thanks to the developers of the R package {blogdown} Yihui Xie, Amber Thomas and Alison Presmanes Hill and the open-source Hugo framework. Much thanks also to Huabing Zhao for sharing his &amp;ldquo;CleanWhite&amp;rdquo; theme!

      <description>Click here for the pdf of my resume.
About Me I am a computational ecologist by training and a data visualization designer by heart. I use statistical and simulation models to answer questions related to the movement ecology of animals and the dynamics of populations, communities and diseases in space and time. To visualize my results and all types of data I use mostly R and the package {ggplot2} from the {tidyverse} which I also use for all kinds of data preparation.</description>

      <description>A collection of data visualizations I&amp;rsquo;ve produced for scientific publications and fun using the {ggplot2}(https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) package in the programming language R. All visualizations are the result of the code without any post-processing. Click on an image to enlarge it.

      <description>Project Overview  BioMove NLMR (Neutral Landscape Models in R) Multidimensionality of Stability AFT (Animal Functional Type Approach) #TidyTuesday  BioMove The DFG funded Research Training Group &amp;lsquo;Integrating Biodiversity Research with Movement Ecology in dynamic agricultural landscapes (BioMove)&amp;rsquo; aims to:
 link innovative individual research projects that overcome the apparent gap between movement ecology and biodiversity research, employing a joint conceptual framework;
 strategically combine empirical, experimental and modelling approaches based in one common study area (AgroScapeLab-Quillow, Brandenburg, Germany) of sufficient size to address questions of varying spatial scales;</description>
