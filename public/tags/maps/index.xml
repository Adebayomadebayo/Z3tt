During a series of massive bushfires across Australia, large areas have been burned and the fires are still burning. The bushfire is one of the worst wildfires globally seen in decades. Although Australia always experiences a fire season during the summer, this time it has been worse than usually: 27 people died and more than 2,000 homes have been destroyed or damaged alone in the worst-hit state of New South Wales.</description>

      <description>What&amp;rsquo;s the #30DayMapChallenge? The #30DayMapChallenge which was initiated by Topi Tjukanov in 2019. The goal is to create a map each day of November with a broad topic provided by Topi, no matter which tool, and to share it with the hashtag &amp;ldquo;#30DayMapChallenge&amp;rdquo; on Twitter.
 The idea is to create (and publish) maps based on different themes on each day of the month using the hashtag #30DayMapChallenge, You can prepare the maps beforehand, but the main idea is to publish maps from specific topics on specific days listed below.</description>
