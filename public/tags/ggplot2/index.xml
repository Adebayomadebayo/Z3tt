      <description>Sunday Two days ago, I was sitting in the sun with a friend working in UX and Graphic Design, chatting about DataViz:
 She: &amp;ldquo;Oh man, last week we had one customer asking for a bar chart race. Do you know these?&amp;rdquo;
Me: &amp;ldquo;Yes&amp;hellip; They are literally EVERYWHERE.1&amp;rdquo; She: &amp;ldquo;Yeah, and we had some tough time to make that work and to customize it in Adobe Animate.&amp;rdquo;
Me: &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;</description>

Introductory WordsI don’t care, just show me the content!
Begin of 2016, I had to prepare my PhD introductory talk and I started using {ggplot2} to visualize my data since I never liked the syntax and style of base plots in R. Because I was short on time, I plotted these figures by try’n’error and with the help of lots of googling. The resource I came always back to was a blog entry called Beautiful plotting in R: A ggplot2 cheatsheet by Zev Ross, posted on 4.</description>

      <description>During my after-thesis-vacation, I managed to tick off two long-term todo&amp;rsquo;s on my list - set up a homepage and to participate in the #TidyTuesday challenge to strengthen my data science and visualization skills and share my work and code tricks with the amazing Rstats community on Twitter. The #TidyTuesday challenge is a excellent opportunity to do so!
What is it about? The R4DS (&amp;ldquo;R for Data Science&amp;rdquo;) online learning community founded by Jesse Maegan is a great opportunity to train skills related to data wrangling and visualization and forms a network of mentors and learners.</description>
