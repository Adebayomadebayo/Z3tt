      <description>What&amp;rsquo;s the #30DayChartChallenge? The #30DayChartChallenge is a data visualization challenge with the aim to create a data visualization on a certain topic for each day of April. Anyone is welcome to contribute, no matter which data source or tool is used to create the visualizations. The challenge is inspired by the #30DayMapChallenge which was initiated by Topi Tjukanov in 2019. I did participate back then and while it was exhausting</description>

      <description>Uff, what a year! 366 days ago, most people did not expect 2020 to be that exhausting, emotionally and physically (and let&amp;rsquo;s hope for a better 2021‚Äîhappy new year to you!). COVID19 was literally everywhere, whether in the media or affecting your personal life, and made it hard to focus and keep social contacts. Plus all the other things that were happening: starting off with the bushfires in Australia, the massive series of police brutality protests after the shocking death of George Floyd, tiring and everlasting Brexit negotiations, Trump&amp;rsquo;s madness reaching new levels, and all the news and uncertainty around COVID19 mutations circulating at the end of 2020.</description>

      <description>Update December 24th 2020: My table made it into the &amp;ldquo;Honourable Mentions&amp;rdquo; section. Congrats to the winner Niels van der Velden and all the others that are mentioned!
In consequence, I decided to visualize the top 250 TV shows according to IMDb users as a more helpful table then the original one on IMDb as my contribution to the ongoing RStudio table contest:
 Tables are a fantastic way to communicate lists of quantitative and qualitative information.</description>

      <description>What&amp;rsquo;s the #30DayMapChallenge? The #30DayMapChallenge which was initiated by Topi Tjukanov in 2019. The goal is to create a map each day of November with a broad topic provided by Topi, no matter which tool, and to share it with the hashtag &amp;ldquo;#30DayMapChallenge&amp;rdquo; on Twitter.
 The idea is to create (and publish) maps based on different themes on each day of the month using the hashtag #30DayMapChallenge, You can prepare the maps beforehand, but the main idea is to publish maps from specific topics on specific days listed below.</description>

      <description>Sunday Two days ago, I was sitting in the sun with a friend working in UX and Graphic Design, chatting about DataViz:
 She: &amp;ldquo;Oh man, last week we had one customer asking for a bar chart race. Do you know these?&amp;rdquo;
Me: &amp;ldquo;Yes&amp;hellip; They are literally EVERYWHERE 1&amp;rdquo;.She: &amp;ldquo;Yeah, and we had some tough time to make that work and to customize it in Adobe Animate.&amp;rdquo;
Me: &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;
She: &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip; and I wondered if you could have done this in R?</description>
