Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19 or simply Corona—what started as an epidemic in China’s Hubei province has become a global pandemic, leading to hundreds of thousands of infections and thousands of deaths so far, national lockdowns and quarantines of cities, #stayhome and #flattenthecurve hashtags—and obviously a global shortage of toilet paper.
When the corona pandemic started, I felt scared, curious and tired at the same time.</description>

During a series of massive bushfires across Australia, large areas have been burned and the fires are still burning. The bushfire is one of the worst wildfires globally seen in decades. Although Australia always experiences a fire season during the summer, this time it has been worse than usually: 27 people died and more than 2,000 homes have been destroyed or damaged alone in the worst-hit state of New South Wales.</description>

      <description>At the end of an exiting second #TidyTuesday year, Jon Harmon, host of the TidyTuesday Podcast, asked on Twitter:
What was your favorite #TidyTuesday dataset of 2019? What were some of your favorite visualizations? Why? Let me know with an @ or via #BestTidyTuesday2019!
&amp;mdash; TidyTuesday Podcast (@tidypod) December 12, 2019 I took this opportunity to recap the last year of contributions to the #TidyTuesday challenge. Immediately, several contributions came to my mind and I tried to pick the best from those I&amp;rsquo;ve seen and which I remember.</description>

      <description>During this time of the year, lunch conversations often focus around the question &amp;ldquo;Will there be snow on Christmas Eve here in Berlin/Germany?&amp;quot;. I remember white Christmas to be a thing when I was a child but in my memory this happened way more often back then than nowadays. And this seems to be in line with the stories of my Berlin-based colleagues about lots of snow during their childhood. But is it true?</description>

      <description>Sunday Two days ago, I was sitting in the sun with a friend working in UX and Graphic Design, chatting about DataViz:
 She: &amp;ldquo;Oh man, last week we had one customer asking for a bar chart race. Do you know these?&amp;rdquo;
Me: &amp;ldquo;Yes&amp;hellip; They are literally EVERYWHERE1&amp;rdquo;.She: &amp;ldquo;Yeah, and we had some tough time to make that work and to customize it in Adobe Animate.&amp;rdquo;
Me: &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;
She: &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip; and I wondered if you could have done this in R?</description>

Introductory WordsI don’t care, just show me the content!
Begin of 2016, I had to prepare my PhD introductory talk and I started using {ggplot2} to visualize my data since I never liked the syntax and style of base plots in R. Because I was short on time, I plotted these figures by try’n’error and with the help of lots of googling. The resource I came always back to was a blog entry called Beautiful plotting in R: A ggplot2 cheatsheet by Zev Ross, posted on 4.</description>

      <title>Hello, TidyTuesday!</title>

      <description>During my after-thesis-vacation, I managed to tick off two long-term todo&amp;rsquo;s on my list - set up a homepage and to participate in the #TidyTuesday challenge to strengthen my data science and visualization skills and share my work and code tricks with the amazing Rstats community on Twitter. The #TidyTuesday challenge is a excellent opportunity to do so!
What is it about? The R4DS (&amp;ldquo;R for Data Science&amp;rdquo;) online learning community founded by Jesse Maegan is a great opportunity to train skills related to data wrangling and visualization and forms a network of mentors and learners.</description>
