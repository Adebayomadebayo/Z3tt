      <description>Curriculum Vitae  sciaini.marco@gmail.com Research Interests My research interests are broad but ultimately linked to ecological patterns and the processes that created them.

To tackle questions arising from linkage I design spatial explicit agent-based models, where all agents are described as unique and autonomous entities that usually interact with each other and their environment locally.</description>
