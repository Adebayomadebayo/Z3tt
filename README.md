**I am a computational ecologist by training and a data visualization designer by heart.**

I am working as a scientifc researcher (PostDoc) in the [Department “Ecological Dynamics”](https://cedricscherer.netlify.app/top/about/) at the [Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research (IZW)](http://www.izw-berlin.de/welcome.html) in Berlin, Germany. Since the beginning of the year I have also been working successfully as a self-employed designer, consultant and instructor in the fields of data visualization and reproducible analysis. My favorite tool for all data-related tasks is [R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html), an open source, highly extensible language for statistical computing and graphics techniques. To visualize data I mainly utilize the package [`{ggplot2}`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) from the [`{tidyverse}` package collection](https://www.tidyverse.org/) including many more that I use on a daily basis for all kinds of data preparation and analysis.

My passion for data, design and coding is a perfect combination not only for scientific but all types of data visualization. By contributing to challenges such as [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/Z3tt/TidyTuesday), [MakeoverMonday](https://github.com/Z3tt/MakeoverMonday), [Storytelling with Data](https://github.com/Z3tt/SWDchallenge) and the [30 Day Map Challenge](https://github.com/Z3tt/30DayMapChallenge), I am constantly strengthening my skills in design and reproducible data visualization with `{ggplot2}`. Thanks to frequent contributions as well as several personal and client projects, my portfolio now includes visualizations for various purposes and is covering a wide range of topics and chart types.
